# What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
- Break it down into smaller pieces: Whenever I encounter a challenging piece of code, logic, or feature, I find it helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. By breaking it down, I can focus on one specific aspect of the problem at a time and prevent myself from feeling overwhelmed. This approach helps me to identify the specific area where I'm stuck, which makes it easier to find a solution.

- Collaborate with peers: When I get stuck, I find it helpful to collaborate with my peers to gain a fresh perspective on the problem. By discussing the problem with others, I often gain new insights that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. Additionally, working with others helps me to stay motivated and accountable, which can be especially helpful when tackling challenging problems.

- Utilize online resources: There are countless online resources available for developers, ranging from blogs and forums to video tutorials and documentation. Whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code or feature, I make sure to take advantage of these resources to gain new insights and find potential solutions. I also make an effort to engage with online communities to ask questions and seek guidance from experienced developers. By utilizing these resources, I am able to learn new skills and gain a deeper understanding of complex topics, which helps me to "un-stick" myself whenever I encounter a challenging problem.
