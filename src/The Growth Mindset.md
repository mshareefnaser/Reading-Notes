# [Deliberate Practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)
Upgrading your technical skills with deliberate practice means intentionally dedicating time and effort to improve your knowledge and abilities in a particular area of technology. Deliberate practice involves setting specific, measurable goals, breaking down complex tasks into smaller components, and repeatedly practicing those components until you have mastered them.

For example, if you are a software developer and you want to improve your skills in a specific programming language, you might set a goal to build a small web application using that language. You would then break down the application into smaller components and practice each component until you have mastered it. You might also seek out resources like online courses or tutorials to supplement your practice.

Deliberate practice is important because it allows you to develop expertise in a specific area and stay current with advancements in technology. It also helps you build confidence in your abilities and provides opportunities to apply your skills in real-world situations. By intentionally practicing and improving your technical skills, you can become a more valuable asset to your team or organization and increase your opportunities for career advancement.
# [The Power of 'Yet'](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)
The idea of the "power of yet" refers to a growth mindset that embraces challenges and views failure as an opportunity for learning and growth. The concept originated from a Chicago high school where students who didn't pass a course received a grade of "Not Yet" instead of a failing grade, which communicated that they were on a learning curve and had a path into the future. This approach highlights the importance of praising the process that kids engage in, their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance, and their improvement, rather than their intelligence or talent.

Studies have shown that when students have a growth mindset, they engage deeply with challenges and mistakes, process the errors, learn from them, and correct them. Conversely, students with a fixed mindset tend to avoid difficulty, cheat, or look for someone who did worse than they did to feel good about themselves. The power of yet can help build confidence, persistence, and resilience, and can change students' mindsets, leading to improvement in grades and academic achievement.

The power of yet can also help address inequality in education by transforming the meaning of effort and difficulty. Growth mindset classrooms that embrace the power of yet have helped underperforming students, such as children in inner cities or on Native American reservations, achieve academic success, sometimes surpassing their more affluent peers. By teaching students that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections, educators can create a path to a brighter future for all students.

In this talk, the speaker discusses their experience teaching seventh-grade math in the New York City public schools and their observation that IQ alone did not determine their students' success. They went on to pursue graduate studies in psychology and conducted research in various challenging settings, looking for predictors of success. Through their studies, they found that grit, defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, was a significant predictor of success across contexts. The speaker also notes the lack of knowledge on how to build grit in individuals, but suggests the idea of growth mindset as a way to encourage perseverance in the face of failure. Finally, the speaker emphasizes the need to continue testing and measuring our approaches to building grit in individuals.
# [A kinder, gentler philosophy of success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)
n this talk, de Botton discusses how society's definition of success is often focused solely on material wealth and status, and suggests that we should instead adopt a more holistic approach to success that takes into account our emotional and psychological wellbeing. He argues that we should focus on creating a culture of kindness and compassion, and that success should be measured by our ability to connect with others and contribute to society in a meaningful way.
