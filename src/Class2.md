#Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that involves writing tests for a feature before actually implementing the feature itself. In TDD, developers write a failing test first, then write the minimum amount of code needed to pass the test, and finally refactor the code to improve its design and maintainability.

In Python, TDD can be implemented using various testing frameworks such as unittest, pytest, and doctest. Writing tests first can help to catch bugs early in the development process and ensure that the code behaves as intended. Additionally, TDD can lead to more modular and maintainable code by encouraging developers to write code that is easily testable and independent of other components.
#What if __name__ == â€œ__main__" do?
The if __name__ == "__main__": statement is a common way to define a block of code that should only run when the script is executed directly (as opposed to being imported as a module into another script). This is because when a Python script is imported as a module into another script, the code in the if __name__ == "__main__": block will not be executed.

#Recursion 
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem. Recursion can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems of the same type.

In a recursive function, the function calls itself with a smaller input until a base case is reached, which is a condition that terminates the recursion. When the base case is reached, the function starts to return the results of the nested function calls back up the call stack to the original caller.

Recursion is a powerful and elegant technique that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as searching and sorting algorithms, tree traversal, and computing mathematical functions. However, recursion can also lead to performance issues and stack overflow errors if not used carefully.

Some of the benefits of using recursion include the readability of code, the ability to solve complex problems in a concise and elegant way, and the ability to break down large problems into smaller sub-problems.
