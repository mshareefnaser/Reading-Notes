**Q1: What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?**

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to securely transmit information between parties. They work by encoding data into three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header describes the token and the cryptographic algorithm used. The payload carries the data. Both the header and payload are encoded in JSON format and then base64 encoded. The signature is generated by combining the encoded header, payload, and a secret key using the specified algorithm. When receiving a JWT, the recipient verifies the signature to ensure the token's authenticity and decodes the base64-encoded header and payload to access the information.

**Q2: How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?**

JWT Authentication can be integrated with Django REST Framework (DRF) to secure API endpoints. The process involves the following key components:

1. JWT Authentication Middleware: A middleware class is added to DRF settings, which checks incoming requests for a JWT in the Authorization header.

2. Token Generation: When a user logs in or authenticates, a JWT token is generated and included in the response.

3. Token Verification: On subsequent requests, the JWT token is sent in the Authorization header. The JWT authentication middleware verifies the token's integrity and decodes the payload to extract user information.

4. User Authentication: The extracted user information is used to authenticate the user and associate the user object with the request.

5. Permission Checks: DRF's permission classes are used to determine if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested API endpoint.

By integrating JWT authentication with DRF, API endpoints can be secured by requiring valid JWT tokens for authorization, enabling stateless communication between the client and the server.

**Q3: Why is Django's built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?**

Django's built-in runserver is not suitable for production environments due to the following reasons:

1. Scalability: The runserver is a single-threaded server, incapable of efficiently handling multiple concurrent requests, which is crucial for production environments with higher traffic.

2. Limited Security Features: The runserver lacks advanced security features required for production, such as HTTPS/SSL support and fine-grained access controls.

3. Performance Limitations: The runserver is optimized for development purposes and may not deliver optimal performance in production.

For deploying a Django application in a production environment, alternative server options that should be considered include:

1. Gunicorn: Gunicorn is a popular choice. It's a pre-fork worker model server capable of handling concurrent requests and offers good performance.

2. uWSGI: uWSGI is another production-grade server frequently used with Django. It supports various protocols and provides extensive configuration options for scalability and performance.

3. Nginx + uWSGI/Gunicorn: Combining a web server like Nginx with a production server like uWSGI or Gunicorn is a common setup. Nginx handles serving static files and acts as a reverse proxy, while the production server processes Django application requests.
