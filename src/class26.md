**Key Components of Django Framework:**

- **Models**: Define the data structure and represent the application's data.
- **Views**: Handle the logic and control the flow of the application.
- **Templates**: Define the structure and presentation of web pages.
- **URLs**: Map incoming requests to specific views.
- **Forms**: Handle user input and data validation.
- **Admin**: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing data.

**Django's MTV Architecture and the Request-Response Cycle:**

- **Model**: Represents the data and interacts with the database.
- **Template**: Defines how the data is presented in HTML.
- **View**: Handles user requests, retrieves data from the model, and passes it to the template.
- The user sends a request to a URL, Django maps it to a view, the view retrieves data from the model, and the template generates an HTML response, which is sent back to the user's browser.

**Purpose of Tailwind CSS and How It Differs from Bootstrap CSS:**

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed utility classes. It focuses on offering a low-level utility class API, allowing for rapid and flexible styling.
- **Bootstrap CSS**: A CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of pre-designed components and styles. It offers a higher-level component-based API for quickly building responsive web interfaces.
- While Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components and predefined styles, Tailwind CSS focuses on providing utility classes for custom styling. Tailwind CSS allows more fine-grained control over styling, while Bootstrap offers a more opinionated and consistent design out-of-the-box.
