1. **React Context:**
   React Context is an API in React that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It allows you to share state or data among multiple components in a React application without the need for explicit prop drilling. Context is especially useful when dealing with data that needs to be accessed by many components at different levels of the component tree.

2. **useContext Hook:**
   The `useContext` Hook is a built-in hook in React that enables functional components to consume data from a React Context. It allows you to access the value stored in the Context directly within the functional component, making it easier to use and access shared data without nesting multiple higher-order components.

3. **Next.js:**
   Next.js is a framework for server-rendered React applications. It aims to make building server-rendered React applications more straightforward and provides several features, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static site generation, and more. It is designed to streamline the development of scalable and high-performance web applications.

**Example from Vercel Next.js Examples:**
In the Vercel Next.js Examples, one popular example is the "Blog" example. This example demonstrates how to build a scalable blog application using Next.js. It showcases features like server-side rendering (SSR) to generate the initial blog posts, and then it uses static site generation (SSG) to pre-render the blog posts at build time for improved performance.

The "Blog" example shows how to fetch data from an external API, generate static pages for individual blog posts, and utilize dynamic routes to create blog post pages. By using Next.js, you can achieve better SEO, improved performance, and a smoother user experience when browsing the blog.
