## Graph Data Structures

Graph data structures are a way to represent relationships or connections between objects. Here is a simplified explanation of graph data structures:

1. **Graph**: A graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships between objects. Nodes can be any type of object, and edges represent the connections or relationships between nodes.

2. **Node/Vertex**: A node or vertex is a fundamental unit of a graph. It represents an object or entity and can hold additional information or properties. Nodes are connected by edges to form the structure of the graph.

3. **Edge**: An edge is a connection between two nodes in a graph. It represents a relationship or link between the connected nodes. Edges can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way), depending on whether the relationship has a specific direction or not.

4. **Weight**: In some graphs, edges can have associated weights or values. These weights represent additional information about the relationship between nodes. For example, in a weighted graph, an edge may represent the distance between two cities, with the weight indicating the distance value.

5. **Directed Graph**: A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph where the edges have a specific direction. The edges indicate a one-way relationship between nodes, meaning they have a specific source node and a target node.

6. **Undirected Graph**: An undirected graph is a graph where the edges do not have a specific direction. The edges represent a two-way relationship between nodes, allowing movement in both directions.

7. **Adjacency**: In a graph, adjacency refers to the relationship between nodes that are directly connected by an edge. If two nodes are adjacent, it means there is a direct connection or relationship between them.

8. **Path**: A path in a graph is a sequence of nodes connected by edges. It represents a route or traversal through the graph, moving from one node to another.
