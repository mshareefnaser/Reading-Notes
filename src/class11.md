## JupyterLab

- JupyterLab is an open-source web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that enables users to create, edit, and run Jupyter notebooks, code, and data all in one place.
- It supports a wide range of programming languages, including Python, and can be highly customized with extensions and themes.
- JupyterLab provides a number of powerful features, such as code highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging, that make coding faster and more efficient.
- It also supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same notebook simultaneously.

## NumPy

- NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning applications, and provides efficient tools for working with different types of data and performing mathematical operations.
- NumPy arrays can be easily manipulated and visualized within JupyterLab notebooks, and the built-in mathematical functions of NumPy can be utilized for complex numerical computations.
