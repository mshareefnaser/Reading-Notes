### Three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript are:

- Arrow functions: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions and lexically bind the `this` value, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.

- Template literals: Template literals allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings, enhancing readability and making string manipulation more convenient.

- Block-scoped variables: The introduction of `let` and `const` keywords enables block-scoped variables, providing better control over variable scope and reducing potential bugs caused by hoisting.

### Utility classes in Tailwind CSS

Utility classes in Tailwind CSS serve as pre-defined CSS classes that encapsulate specific styles or utility functions. They allow developers to apply common styles quickly and efficiently without having to write custom CSS. For example, to style an HTML element using utility classes, you can add the classes directly in the element's class attribute, like this: `<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">...</div>`. Here, the classes `bg-blue-500` sets the background color to blue, `text-white` sets the text color to white, and `p-4` adds padding of 4 units.

### The main advantages of using Next.js for web development, as highlighted in the article, are:

- Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js enables server-side rendering, which improves initial page load times and enhances SEO by providing fully rendered HTML to the client.

- Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits JavaScript bundles based on the routes, optimizing the loading performance by loading only the necessary code for each page.

- Built-in API routes: Next.js allows developers to create API routes alongside the pages, making it easier to build backend functionality within the same framework.
