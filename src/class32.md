**Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions:**

- Purpose: DRF Permissions provide a way to control access and secure APIs by defining who can perform certain actions on specific resources.
- Key Components:
  - Permission Classes: These define the rules for granting or denying access to API views.
  - `IsAuthenticated`: Ensures that the user making the request is authenticated.
  - `AllowAny`: Allows unrestricted access to the API view, even for unauthenticated users.
  - `IsAdminUser`: Requires the user to be a staff user or superuser.
  - `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`: Allows read-only access to unauthenticated users but requires authentication for write operations.
  - Custom Permissions: Developers can create custom permission classes to suit specific authorization requirements.
- Functionality: DRF permissions help in securing an API by:
  - Restricting access to certain views or actions based on user authentication or authorization levels.
  - Enforcing granular control over API endpoints, allowing different levels of access based on user roles or permissions.
  - Safeguarding sensitive data and preventing unauthorized modifications or deletions.

**SELECT Statement in SQL:**

- Purpose: The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table.
- Usage for retrieving all columns from the 'employees' table:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees;
  ```
  - The asterisk (*) is used as a wildcard character to select all columns.
  - The statement selects all rows and columns from the 'employees' table, returning the result as a result set.

**DRF Generic Views:**

- Role: DRF Generic Views provide pre-implemented views for common API operations, reducing the need to write repetitive code and simplifying API development.
- Examples of Usage:
  - `ListAPIView`: Retrieves a list of objects from the database and serializes them into a response.
  - `CreateAPIView`: Handles object creation through a POST request.
  - `RetrieveAPIView`: Retrieves a single object based on a unique identifier.
  - `UpdateAPIView`: Updates an existing object through a PUT or PATCH request.
  - `DestroyAPIView`: Deletes an object using a DELETE request.
- Benefits:
  - Simplifies the creation of API views for common operations by providing default behaviors.
  - Reduces the amount of code required, making development faster and more concise.
  - Allows customization and extension by overriding methods or properties specific to the view's functionality.
  - Ensures adherence to RESTful API design principles by providing consistent and predictable endpoint behaviors.
