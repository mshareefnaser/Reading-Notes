# Introduction 
- The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based way of interacting with a computer's operating system.
- The CLI has several advantages over a Graphical User Interface (GUI), such as the ability to perform complex tasks quickly and efficiently, and the ability to automate tasks.
- The CLI uses a shell, which is a program that interprets and executes commands entered by the user.
- The most common shell on Linux and macOS is the Bash shell, while the default shell on Windows is Command Prompt.
- The CLI uses a set of commands that are entered by typing in text and pressing enter. These commands can be used to perform various tasks, such as navigating through the file system, creating and deleting files, and managing processes.
- The CLI can be intimidating for beginners, but with practice and familiarity, it can be a powerful tool for productivity and efficiency.
# Basic Navigation
- The 'pwd' command shows the current working directory.
- The 'ls' command lists the files and directories in the current working directory.
- The 'cd' command is used to change directories.
- The 'cd ..' command is used to move up one directory level.
- The 'mkdir' command creates a new directory.
- The 'rmdir' command removes a directory (if it is empty).
- The 'touch' command creates a new empty file.
- The 'cp' command copies files or directories.
- The 'mv' command moves or renames files or directories.
- The 'rm' command removes files or directories.
# More About Files 
- Files in Linux and Unix-like systems are organized in a hierarchical structure called the file system.
- The file system is represented by a single root directory, denoted by a forward slash (/).
- Directories are like folders and can contain other files and directories.
- Files and directories in Linux have permissions that specify who can read, write, and execute them.
- The 'chmod' command can be used to change file permissions.
- Each file has a user owner and a group owner, which can be changed using the 'chown' and 'chgrp' commands.
- File names in Linux are case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Hidden files and directories are denoted by a dot (.) at the beginning of their names.
- The 'file' command can be used to determine the type of a file.
- The 'locate' and 'find' commands can be used to search for files on the system.
# Manual Pages 
- The manual pages, or 'man pages', provide documentation and information about commands and programs installed on a Unix-like system.
- The 'man' command is used to view manual pages.
- Manual pages are organized into sections, such as User Commands, System Calls, and Library Functions.
- The section number can be specified with the 'man' command to view the appropriate manual page.
- Manual pages contain a description of the command, its syntax, its options, and its examples.
- The 'apropos' command can be used to search for a command or topic in the manual pages.
- The 'whatis' command provides a brief description of a command or topic.
- Some manual pages have links to related manual pages, which can be accessed by pressing the 'h' key while viewing the page.
- Manual pages are an essential resource for learning and using the command line effectively.
# File Manupilating 
- The 'touch' command creates a new empty file or updates the modification time of an existing file.
- The 'cp' command copies files and directories.
- The 'mv' command moves or renames files and directories.
- The 'rm' command removes files and directories.
- The 'mkdir' command creates a new directory.
- The 'rmdir' command removes a directory (if it is empty).
- The 'ln' command creates hard or symbolic links between files.
- The 'file' command displays the type of a file.
- The 'gzip' and 'gunzip' commands compress and decompress files using the gzip algorithm.
- The 'tar' command creates and extracts archives of files and directories.
- The 'zip' and 'unzip' commands compress and decompress files using the zip algorithm.
