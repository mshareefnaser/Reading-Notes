# classes and objects in Python
Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, including Python. Here's an explanation of the key differences between classes and objects in Python and how they're used to create and manage instances of a class:

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
Classes define the attributes and behaviors of an object, while objects represent the actual instance of those attributes and behaviors.
Classes are defined using the "class" keyword in Python, while objects are created using the class constructor, which is invoked using the name of the class followed by parentheses.
When an object is created, it inherits all the attributes and behaviors defined by its class. It can also have its own unique attributes and behaviors.
Objects can interact with each other and with the rest of the program, using methods defined by their class.
To create and manage instances of a class in Python, you would typically follow these steps:

Define the class using the "class" keyword and specify its attributes and methods.
Create an object by invoking the class constructor with the desired arguments. This creates a new instance of the class with the specified attributes and behaviors.
Access and modify the object's attributes and behaviors using dot notation, which allows you to interact with the object's methods and attributes.
Use the object to perform tasks and interact with other parts of the program, either on its own or in collaboration with other objects.
#  Recursion and best practices
Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. The function continues to call itself until it reaches a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursion.

Here's an example of how recursion can be used to solve a problem in Python. Let's say we want to calculate the factorial of a number. We can use a recursive function to do this:

``` Python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

In this example, the function "factorial" calls itself with a smaller argument each time until it reaches the base case of n = 0. Then, the function returns 1, and the recursive calls continue to unwind and calculate the factorial of the original number.

When implementing a recursive function in Python, there are several best practices to follow:

1. Define a base case to avoid infinite recursion.
2. Ensure that each recursive call makes progress towards the base case.
3. Avoid creating unnecessary copies of data to improve performance.
4. Use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Test your recursive function with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.
# Pytest Fixtures
Pytest fixtures provide a fixed baseline for tests to run under by providing reusable objects and functions that set up preconditions and provide resources for testing. Code coverage is a metric that measures how much of your code is covered by tests, helping you ensure that your tests are comprehensive. Together, pytest fixtures and code coverage improve the quality and maintainability of a project by reducing code duplication, simplifying test setup, and identifying under-tested code.
