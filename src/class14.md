**Key Differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh:**

1. **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python that provides a flexible and low-level interface for creating a wide range of visualizations. It offers fine-grained control over plot elements and customization options. Matplotlib is suitable for creating basic plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc. It is highly customizable but requires more code to create complex visualizations.

   Example: Creating a line plot to visualize the trend of a variable over time.

2. **Seaborn:** Seaborn is a higher-level statistical visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a simplified interface and offers a wide range of statistical visualizations with attractive default styles. Seaborn is suitable for exploring and visualizing complex datasets, including categorical data, relationships between variables, and distributional characteristics.

   Example: Creating a box plot to compare the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories.

3. **Bokeh:** Bokeh is a powerful interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers. It focuses on providing interactive and visually appealing visualizations for displaying data in web applications or interactive dashboards. Bokeh supports various types of interactive plots, including interactive scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and geographical plots.

   Example: Creating an interactive scatter plot that allows zooming, panning, and tooltips to explore data points in detail.

**Main Functions in Seaborn for Different Plot Types:**

1. **Relational Plots:** Seaborn provides functions like `scatterplot()`, `lineplot()`, and `relplot()` for creating relational plots. These plots are used to visualize relationships between variables, such as the correlation between two continuous variables.

   Example Use Case: Creating a scatter plot to examine the relationship between a car's horsepower and its fuel efficiency.

2. **Categorical Plots:** Seaborn offers functions like `barplot()`, `countplot()`, `boxplot()`, `violinplot()`, and `catplot()` for creating categorical plots. These plots are used to visualize categorical variables or the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories.

   Example Use Case: Creating a box plot to compare the distribution of exam scores across different educational levels.

3. **Distribution Plots:** Seaborn provides functions like `histplot()`, `kdeplot()`, and `displot()` for creating distribution plots. These plots are used to visualize the distribution of a variable or to compare the distribution of multiple variables.

   Example Use Case: Creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages in a population.

**Role of Seaborn Cheat Sheet:**

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a quick reference guide for Python developers working with Seaborn. It provides concise and easily accessible information about the various functionalities and features of Seaborn. Key sections and elements in the cheat sheet include:

1. **Plotting Functions:** The cheat sheet lists the main plotting functions available in Seaborn, categorized by plot types, such as relational plots, categorical plots, and distribution plots. This helps developers quickly identify the appropriate function for their visualization needs.

2. **Visual Examples:** The cheat sheet provides visual examples of different plot types, showcasing their appearance and usage. These examples give developers a clear understanding of how to create specific plots and what the resulting visualizations look like.

3. **Customization Options:** The cheat sheet highlights important customization options and parameters that can be used to modify the appearance of plots. It provides details on how to control colors, styles, axes, legends, and other visual elements.

4. **Statistical Functions:** Seaborn incorporates statistical analysis into its visualizations. The cheat sheet includes information on
