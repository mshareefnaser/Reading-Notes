# Reading-Notes
Welcome to my personal readings repo 🐱‍👤 Here, I share my personal notes and thoughts on a variety of topics that I'm interested in, including programming, technology💻, and personal development🚀. This repo serves as a platform for me to organize and consolidate my notes from various sources, including books 📚, articles📃, and online coursess👨🏻‍💻. It also serves as a reference for myself to revisit and review my past learnings. I hope that my notes can also be useful to others who share similar interests🤟.
